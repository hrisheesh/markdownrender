## 7. Dense ordinary Markdown after recovery

1. **Do not make the model produce an entire HTML page** when Markdown plus a compact structured block expresses the same intent.
2. Keep the raw response inspectable; every table and fence in this lab is editable in the left panel.
3. Test messy output deliberately:
   - [x] long source names
   - [x] wide tables
   - [x] different chart families
   - [x] valid and invalid structured blocks
   - [ ] your production retrieval policy and real customer vocabulary

The weighted confidence score remains $S = 0.45q + 0.35c + 0.20f$, where $q$ is evidence quality, $c$ is citation coverage, and $f$ is source freshness. A high score is useful only when the reader can inspect the evidence that produced it.`;

    content: `# Migration recommendation

## Decision

Move the team to the staged migration plan. It gives us the lowest operational risk while preserving the option to pause after the first customer cohort. The evidence is consistent across support volume, release telemetry, and the security review. [cite:release-brief] [cite:security-review]

The recommendation is intentionally simple: ship the compatibility layer first, observe real traffic for one week, and only then remove the legacy endpoint. There is no need to force every customer into the new flow on day one.

## Why this is the right trade-off

The current implementation is reliable but expensive to maintain. The replacement reduces duplicate logic and improves response consistency, while the compatibility layer keeps the rollout reversible. The main risk is not the renderer itself; it is the quality of the source material that reaches the model.

| Option | Reader impact | Engineering cost | Risk | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Big-bang replacement | Fast if successful | High | High | Avoid |
| Staged migration | Gradual and visible | Medium | Low | **Choose this** |
| Keep legacy forever | No immediate change | Rising over time | Medium | Avoid |

## First-week checklist

- [x] Keep the raw model response available in diagnostics.
- [x] Send trusted citation metadata alongside the response.
- [ ] Compare grounded-answer rate before and after rollout.
- [ ] Review the first ten escalation paths with support.

> The goal is not to create more interface. It is to let the answer become easier to trust.

## What would change the decision

Pause if the error rate rises above the existing baseline, if citations stop resolving, or if a customer-facing answer loses important context during streaming. Otherwise, continue to the next cohort after seven days of stable results.`,

    id: "incident-review",
    label: "Incident review",
    description: "A realistic operational response with a timeline, code, and calm recovery guidance.",
    content: `# Search latency incident: final update

The elevated latency was caused by a retrieval fan-out regression introduced in the 09:15 deployment. The system stayed available, but p95 response time increased from 142ms to 1.8s for roughly 24 minutes. No customer data was lost and no authorization boundary was bypassed. [cite:incident-log]

## Timeline

- **09:15** — The release reached 100% of production traffic.
- **09:22** — p95 latency alert triggered; on-call began triage.
- **09:29** — Retrieval fan-out was identified as the common factor.
- **09:36** — Traffic was rolled back to the previous configuration.
- **09:39** — Latency returned to baseline.
- **10:10** — We completed a sample review of affected answers.

## Root cause

A new fallback path performed two retrieval passes when the first pass returned fewer than five passages. That behavior was safe for correctness but not bounded for latency. The change looked harmless in local tests because the fixture corpus returned enough passages on the first pass.

\`\`\`ts
const passages = await retrieve(query);
return passages.length < 5
  ? [...passages, ...(await retrieve(query, { broaden: true }))]
  : passages;
\`\`\`

## Follow-up

1. Add a hard retrieval budget to the request path.
2. Add sparse-result fixtures to the release test suite.
3. Keep the user-facing response calm: show partial Markdown as it arrives instead of waiting for optional structured presentation.

The rollback fixed the immediate problem. The follow-up work is about making the safe path fast as well.`,

    content: `# Can EU administrators export audit history?

Yes. EU workspace administrators can export audit history, provided the workspace is on the current retention plan and the export stays within the 90-day window. The export includes actor, timestamp, action, and resource metadata; it does not include deleted content bodies. [cite:policy-eu] [cite:audit-guide]

## Important limits

- Exports are generated asynchronously and are retained for 24 hours.
- A workspace administrator must initiate the request.
- Legal holds can extend retention but do not grant broader export access.
- Older workspaces may need a retention-plan migration before the export control appears.

    { "label": "Answer confidence", "value": "High", "detail": "direct policy match" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## Why the answer is qualified

The retention period is a policy condition, not a technical limitation. If the workspace was created before the current plan, confirm the plan in the admin console before promising an export date. A useful confidence model is $S = 0.45q + 0.35c + 0.20f$, where evidence quality, citation coverage, and freshness should all be visible to the reader.

## Recommended next step

Ask the administrator to open **Settings → Audit history → Export**, select the requested date range, and confirm that the workspace is marked as EU. If the control is absent, send the workspace ID to support with the current plan name.`,

We are on track for the customer preview, with two details worth watching: the final copy review and the data migration dry run. The next release does not need a dashboard to communicate this; the useful information is the decision, the open risk, and the owner.

\`\`\`python

    if n <= 0: return []
    if n == 1: return [0]
    
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for _ in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

print(f"Fib(10) = {calculate_fibonacci(10)}")

### JSON Payload
\`\`\`json

  "api_version": "v2",
  "status": 200,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "usr_98a7f",

      "isActive": true
    }

\`\`\`

## 4. LaTeX Math Rendering

### Display Math (Block)
The Riemann zeta function is defined as:
$$
\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s} = \\prod_{p \\text{ prime}} \\frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}}
$$

### Inline Math
Einstein's famous equation $E = mc^2$ shows the equivalence of mass and energy, where $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$).

## 5. GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)

### Tables
| Feature | Supported | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Mermaid** | ✅ | Native rendering of diagrams and charts |
| **KaTeX** | ✅ | Complex math equations |
| **XSS Protection** | ✅ | Strict AST sanitization |
| **Tables** | ✅ | Responsive data tables |

### Task Lists
- [x] Refactor Rich Text Engine
- [x] Secure against XSS
- [x] Fix React Hydration Issues
- [ ] Implement Admonitions (Callouts)

## 6. Typography & Blockquotes

> **Design Philosophy**
> 
> "Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent."
> — *Joe Sparano*

This demonstrates how the rich text engine handles **bold text**, *italic text*, ~~strikethrough~~, and \`inline code\` blocks wrapped seamlessly around inline citations like this one [1].
